# Introduction
This project involves implementing a RShell, a basic command shell written in C++ that satisfies these criterias: 
1. Print command prompts.
2. Read in command lines. Distinguishing between executables, arguments, connectors, and commands.
3. Execute commands using fork, execvp, waitpid.

In addition, this project will be implemented using the composite pattern as the core design principle.
